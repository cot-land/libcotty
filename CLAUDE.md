# Cotty — AI Session Instructions

## ABSOLUTE #1 RULE — NEVER WORKAROUND, NEVER SIMPLIFY

**NEVER implement workarounds for missing Cot language features.** If the Cot compiler doesn't support a pattern you need, **STOP and tell the user** so they can implement the missing feature in the Zig compiler first. Cotty must use idiomatic Cot — every workaround is tech debt that defeats the purpose of dogfooding.

- **NO** restructuring code to avoid a language limitation
- **NO** extracting logic to helper functions just because a construct doesn't compile
- **NO** falling back to if-else chains because switch doesn't support something
- **NO** simplifying data structures because generics don't work for a case
- **ALWAYS** identify the exact compiler limitation and report it to the user
- The user will fix the Zig compiler. That is the correct workflow.

## DO NOT PUT ANY LOGIC INTO SWIFT

**SWIFT IS A THIN SHELL. ALL LOGIC LIVES IN COT.**

Cotty is a dogfooding project. The ENTIRE POINT is to exercise the Cot language by writing real application logic in Cot. Swift exists ONLY as a platform binding layer — it calls Cot FFI functions and renders what Cot tells it to render. Nothing more.

- **NO** implementing features in Swift that should be in Cot
- **NO** Swift-side workarounds for Cot compiler bugs — fix the compiler instead
- **NO** duplicating logic between Swift and Cot (PTY spawning, input handling, state management)
- **NO** "temporary" Swift implementations — they become permanent tech debt
- Swift may ONLY: create windows, set up Metal layers, forward raw input events to Cot, and render from Cot's data
- If a Cot runtime function crashes in dylib mode, the fix goes in the Zig compiler, NOT in Swift
- Every line of logic in Swift is a line that ISN'T dogfooding Cot

## NEVER REVERT PROGRESS BECAUSE OF A COMPILER BUG

When a feature works correctly but exposes a compiler bug (e.g., a missing runtime function, broken ABI, or dylib-mode issue), the correct response is:

1. **Keep the working code exactly as written**
2. **Document the compiler bug** in `~/cotlang/cot/claude/` with root cause and fix instructions
3. **Tell the user** what compiler fix is needed so they can implement it
4. **Wait for the fix**, then continue

**NEVER** undo working feature code because a compiler limitation causes a cosmetic issue or partial failure. The whole point of this project is to push the compiler forward. Reverting progress defeats the purpose and destroys work.

Example of what NOT to do: implementing terminal grid resize that works correctly, then reverting it to hardcoded 24x80 because `ioctl_winsize` has a bug in dylib mode. The resize code is correct — the compiler is wrong. Fix the compiler.

## CRITICAL RULES

### 1. Never Invent — Copy Ghostty/Zed Patterns

Cotty's architecture is modeled on Ghostty. When implementing a component, **ALWAYS search the Ghostty reference code FIRST** (`references/ghostty/`), read and understand the implementation, then translate to Cot. Don't invent patterns — copy them.

- **ALWAYS** search Ghostty before writing ANY new feature or handler
- **NEVER** implement logic without first finding the Ghostty equivalent
- If you haven't read the Ghostty code, you haven't done the prerequisite step
- If Ghostty doesn't have a reference for something, say so before proceeding

### 2. Cot Language Reference Is ~/cotlang/cot

The Cot compiler lives at `~/cotlang/cot` (developed in parallel). When you need syntax examples, read `~/cotlang/cot/self/*.cot` for real working code. Read `~/cotlang/cot/docs/syntax.md` for the full syntax reference. **Never use archive folders.**

### 3. @safe Mode Enabled Project-Wide

Cotty uses `"safe": true` in `cot.json`. This enables:
- **Colon struct init**: `Type { field: value }` (not `.field = value`)
- **Implicit self**: methods get `self` injected automatically (no `self: *Type` parameter)
- **Auto-ref**: pass structs without `&`
- **`static fn`** constructors (no self injection)
- `/// doc comments`
- `test "name" { }` inline tests at bottom of files

### 4. Stdlib via Symlink

The Cot stdlib is resolved via a local symlink: `stdlib -> ~/cotlang/cot/stdlib`. This keeps cot-land projects always using the latest compiler stdlib with zero friction. The symlink is gitignored.

**Setup (one-time):**
```bash
cd ~/cot-land/cotty
ln -s ~/cotlang/cot/stdlib stdlib
```

## Project Overview

**Cotty** is a purpose-built developer environment for Cot, modeled on Ghostty's architecture but pivoting from terminal emulation to text editing. This is a dogfooding project — we're writing a real application in Cot to push the language forward.

## CLI

```
cot check src/main.cot          # Type-check the full project
cot test src/buffer.cot         # Run buffer tests
cot test src/cursor.cot         # Run cursor tests
cot test src/app.cot            # Run app tests
cot run src/main.cot -- help    # Print usage
cot run src/main.cot -- version # Print version
```

## Architecture

```
src/main.cot       Entry point, CLI dispatch
src/app.cot        Application state (surfaces, config, mailbox)
src/surface.cot    Editor surface (buffer + cursor + viewport)
src/buffer.cot     Gap buffer text storage
src/cursor.cot     Cursor position tracking
src/config.cot     Configuration loading
src/input.cot      Input event handling
src/message.cot    Mailbox messages for inter-component comms
```

```
User Input → InputAction → Surface.handleInput()
                              ├── Buffer.insert/delete (text mutation)
                              ├── Cursor.move* (position update)
                              └── Message → App.drainMailbox() (cross-component)

App.tick()
  ├── drainMailbox() → process queued messages
  └── Surface.render() → output
```

## Reference File Map

| Cotty File | Ghostty/Zed Reference |
|---|---|
| `src/main.cot` | `references/ghostty/src/main_ghostty.zig` |
| `src/app.cot` | `references/ghostty/src/App.zig` |
| `src/surface.cot` | `references/ghostty/src/Surface.zig` |
| `src/buffer.cot` | `references/zed/crates/rope/` (concept), custom gap buffer |
| `src/config.cot` | `references/ghostty/src/config.zig` |
| `src/input.cot` | `references/ghostty/src/input.zig` |
| `src/message.cot` | `references/ghostty/src/App.zig` (Mailbox/Message) |

## Testing

```bash
cot test src/buffer.cot    # Core data structure — must always pass
cot test src/cursor.cot    # Cursor logic
cot test src/app.cot       # App lifecycle
cot check src/main.cot     # Full type-check
```

Every file has inline `test "name" { }` blocks. Run `cot test <file>` to execute them.

## Behavioral Guidelines

**DO:**
- Read the Ghostty reference before implementing any component
- Copy `~/cotlang/cot/self/` code patterns exactly (colon init, implicit self, static fn)
- Write inline tests for every module
- Use `cot check` and `cot test` to verify changes
- Make incremental changes, verify each one
- Report missing Cot features to the user immediately

**DO NOT:**
- Invent patterns — copy reference implementations
- Work around compiler limitations
- Skip testing
- Use period-prefix struct init (`.field = value`) — use colon syntax (`field: value`)
- Comment out failing tests or leave TODOs
- Read from archive folders — always use `~/cotlang/cot`
